      text: >- 
        After having worked at some of the best technology companies, we’ve come together to solve the most exciting technical problems. We share an entrepreneurial spirit, and a hunger to create solutions that matter.
        Our mission is to bring open consensus to 10 billion people. It’s something we’ll tell our grandkids about, and we want to have fun making it happen.

        We’re on a bold mission with a clear target, but the journey to get there matters a lot to us. We want to build a global community that shares our values — empathy, passion, and excellence.
        We put in the hours to make things happen, but we also get together for happy hours every now and then. After a long week, we unwind with team yoga. Gym memberships and Macbook Pros are covered, right alongside daily in-house meals. It’s work, the way we think it should be.
