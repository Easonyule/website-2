  heading: Decentralization at Scale
  description:
    - segment: Our goal is to deliver scalability and decentralization. The promise of blockchain is to enable decentralized coordination at scale but no platform has yet been able to achieve both. Harmony aims to change that.
    - segment: Similar to the way Google vertically integrates its search infrastructure, we take a full stack approach to solve consensus at scale. We apply 10x innovations at every layer in consensus algorithms, systems and networking to maximize the performance of our network while maintaining decentralization. Our end-to-end integration allows us to iterate faster and make more aggressive optimizations than could be done with a modular approach.
