title: Our Technology
description: >-
  We believe scalability requires optimization across multiple layers. Our
  full-stack approach applies 10x innovations in networking, systems, and
  consensus algorithms.

      Our consensus protocol uses design principles such as sharding and
      pipelining to parallelize transaction processing. This allows us to
      effectively handle connection latency and enables our throughput to scale
      with the size of our network.

      We are developing a lean, mission specific kernel to run our protocol with
      increased CPU performance and security. This will also allow a broader set
      of devices to participate in consensus for a more decentralized network.

      We implement network engineering techniques for smarter message
      propagation and faster consensus formation. An understanding of network
      topology allows us to run a highly concurrent protocol.
